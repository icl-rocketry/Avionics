About SPIMemory
################

The SPIMemory library project aims to be a single unified Arduino library that allows for communication with a variety of data storage ICs that communicate via the SPI protocol.

**Current status:**

In its current form (as of v3.2.0), this library supports read/write/erase functions on a number of SPI Flash memory ICs through its ``SPIFlash`` class.

**In the works:**

Work on a new class ``SPIFRAM``, is currently in progress and when released it will support read/write/erase functions on a number of SPI FRAM memory ICs.

**Ideas for future development:**

Support for SPI EEPROMs
